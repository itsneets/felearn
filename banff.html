       <h1> I Want To Go To There </h1>
       <h2> Location: Banff </h2>
       <p>Located in western Canada, Banff is popular for natural beauty and winter sports.</p> 
       <ol>
        <li>Expense Level:  Low.  Flights are reasonable.</li>
        <li>Length of Air Travel:  Medium. It's not much farther than California.</li>
        <li>Culture:  Low.  I'd be visiting more for natural beauty but if there are indigenous peoples to learn about, that would be cool.</li>
        <li>Food: Low.  Very similar to food in the US.</li>
      </ol>
