       <h1> I Want To Go To There </h1>
       <h2> Location: Iceland</h2>
       <p>Located at the northernmost part of Europe, Iceland is a popular destination these days.</p> 
       <ol>
        <li>Expense Level:  Medium.  Flights are not more expensive than other locations and there are good accommodations.  Food and excursions will be expensive.</li>
        <li>Length of Air Travel:  Medium. It's a long flight from Florida, but I probably will end up with a layover in NYC.</li>
        <li>Culture:  Medium.  There are certainly cultural highlights, but this is more of a natural beauty kind of trip.</li>
        <li>Food: Low.  While I always try anything, I don't find the food scene as exciting.</li>
      </ol>
