       <h1> I Want To Go To There </h1>
       <h2> Location: Greece </h2>
       <p>Located in southern Europe, Greece is a popular destination for historical and beach afficionados.</p> 
       <ol>
        <li>Expense Level:  Medium-High.  Flights to Europe have been high. I can probably get a varying level of accommodations and use Airbnb experiences.</li>
        <li>Length of Air Travel:  Medium. Typical for most European flights from Florida.</li>
        <li>Culture:  High.  Greek culture is interesting to me historically but also has a great modern interest as well. Philosophy, arts and religion were all influenced here.</li>
        <li>Food: High.  Greek food is my jam.</li>
      </ol>
