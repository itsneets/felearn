       <h1> I Want To Go To There </h1>
       <h2> Location: Australia </h2>
       <p>A continent on the other side of the world.</p> 
       <ol>
        <li>Expense Level:  High.  Flights to Australia are high. I can probably get a varying level of accommodations and use Airbnb experiences.</li>
        <li>Length of Air Travel:  High. It can take a whold 24 hours to get there.</li>
        <li>Culture:  Medium.  I'd love to learn more about Maori cultures for the most part. But Sydney does have the famous opera house, and there is a sort of surf culture as well.</li>
        <li>Food: Low.  Nothing here is that exciting.  Mostly food appropriated from Colonization, I think???</li>
      </ol>
